# wideband-signal-dataset-generation
This project provides a MATLAB script for generating radio frequency (RF) signal spectrogram datasets for semantic segmentation tasks. The script can generate synthetic signals containing 9 different modulation types and automatically generate corresponding spectrograms and multi-class semantic segmentation labels.
